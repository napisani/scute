you are an expert code reviewer and software developer.
I need to to make an assessement of this entire codebase.
you make a plan for suggested changes, based on our sweep and review of the code.
review the code for the following aspects:
1. Code Quality and Maintainability
2. Performance Optimization
3. Idiomatic ways of coding using Typescript + React
4. Most importantly, simplicity - look for opeations that are overly complex with obvious simpler alternatives with minimal tradeoffs
5. Security Best Practices
6. Shell compatibility and robustness
7. Error Handling and Logging
8. Testing Coverage and Quality
